## 11. Post-Launch Activities (Ongoing)

21. Gather user feedback and make improvements
22. Monitor application performance and scale as necessary
23. Regularly update dependencies and apply security patches

Remember to version control your code at each step and to break down these main steps into smaller, manageable tasks. Regular code reviews and team meetings (if working in a team) are also crucial for maintaining code quality and project progress.
