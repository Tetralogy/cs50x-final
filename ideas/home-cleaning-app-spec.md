## 4. System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

1. **Presentation Layer:** Flask templates, JavaScript for dynamic content
2. **Application Layer:** Flask routes and controllers
3. **Business Logic Layer:** Python modules for task management, scheduling, and analysis
4. **Data Access Layer:** SQLAlchemy ORM
5. **Database Layer:** SQLite database

### Component Interaction

- Flask routes handle HTTP requests and responses
- Controllers interact with the business logic layer
- Business logic layer processes data and interacts with the data access layer
- SQLAlchemy ORM manages database operations
- Asynchronous tasks (e.g., email sending, data analysis) handled by Celery

## 5. Database Design

3. **Rooms**

   - id (PK), home_id (FK), name, type, size
4. **Tasks**

   - id (PK), room_id (FK), name, description, frequency, last_completed
5. **TaskInstances**

   - id (PK), task_id (FK), scheduled_for, completed_at, before_photo, after_photo
6. **UserAbilities**

   - id (PK), user_id (FK), ability_type, level
7. **Products**
